Program for solving chromatic number problem (graph multicoloring). 
Implementing global search with constraints and branch and bound techniques.
Program uses Semidefinite programming relaxation to find the lower bound of chromatic number.
Computing the lower bound as Lovasz Number using CSDP solver library. 
Download and compile Csdp before linking this program.
